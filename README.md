## What is a host file?                 
       
 A hosts file, named hosts, is a plain-text file used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses. Host file preferred over DNS so  if a domain name is resolved by the hosts file, the request never leaves your computer.
 
## Notice

- We block **`graph.facebook.com`**. The reason is that this domain serves many of the ads.  So, in order to use Facebook, you should consider to `whitelist either facebook's main app, or whitelist graph.facebook.com in your ad blocker` â€” **otherwise the Facebook app will not work** (there are no problems with facebook lite app and other facebook client apps).  If you are using `Facebook lite messenger`, then `whitelist the app or whitelist mqtt-mini.facebook.com`. Otherwise messenger will not work. We always recommend our users to use Open Source Facebook Clients for 100% ad free experience.  If you are facing any problems feel free to contact us through XDA or Telegram.

- GoodbyeAds-Ultra Discontinued.

## Support

Maintaining a quality blocking project takes a lot of time. GoodbyeAds is completely independently funded. We fight for our users. This does mean
however that we also have to spend our owns to pay the bills. This is where you can help: by chipping in you can ensure more time is spent improving GoodbyeAds rather than dealing with distractions.

This donation is for our services, not for any pack, resource or any other mean. Your support will help us keep the project running and provide you quality service.
